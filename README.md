# Fuel_efficiency

The initial aim of this project was to just build a sequence learning model to correctly predict fuel efficiency using the given dataset.

But at later point I have tried to work with google api services to connect google drive api to my local system and download the dataset from the google drive and read it.
As cloud has been a critical part of everday life this project aims a little on how to use the google api services to use cloud services efficiently.
